				This is Batota — a mix of programming, IT, and a long journey through bugs, errors, and bad decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The name comes from code, curiosity, and a famous traveler who went far.
				I travel too — mostly between Stack Overflow, documentation, and mistakes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here I write about what I learn in tech, usually after doing it the wrong way first.
